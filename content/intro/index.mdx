## Getting Started

1. Having Node installed beforehand, bootstrap a new project with `npx create-next-app my-awesome-book -e https://github.com/amiroff/NextBook`
2. Run `npm run dev:watch` and open [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/)
3. Check documentation to see what's possible with NextBook.
4. Create your [markdown](/reference/markdown) or [MDX](/reference/using-mdx) content in `content` folder. Pages should auto-refresh as you modify markdown content.
5. Update `config/config.json` with your table of contents and other information.
6. Update `pages/index.jsx` to suit your needs as a standalone landing page or as a redirect to content.
7. [Deploy](https://vercel.com/new) your repository to any static hosting provider like Vercel, Netlify, Github Pages or Google Cloud.
8. Have fun! 🎉

This should be enough to have a statically generated documentation page / book.

With the advantages of [Next.js](https://nextjs.com) and [React](https://reactjs.org), anything fancy (grading, level switching...) can be added along the way.

## What's New In NextBook 3.0?

**We want to get you ahead.** When you graduate from our program, **you’ll have real product team experience** working in a development shop that other graduates from other programs won’t have. That’s going to help you **land a job** and perform better than all the other new hires, meaning more salary and job growth, **_faster_**

- Migrated to `next-mdx-remote v.4` which now uses `MDX2`. This has some speed improvements and stricter MDX syntax checking. See [MDX2](https://mdxjs.com/blog/v2/)
- Replaced some custom incompatible markdown plugins with MDX counterparts. These are:
    - Subscript: was `~`, became `<sub>` tag.
    - Superscript: was `^`, became `<sup>` tag.
    - Mark (higlight): was `==`, became `<mark>` tag.
    - Changed syntax for `Accordion` and `Tabs` components. See related documentation.
- Removed functionality
    - Indented code. This was removed from `MDX2`. Use other ways to define fenced code blocks.
    - Linking with angle brackets: This was removed from `MDX2`. Use other ways to define links.

## What's New In NextBook 2.0?

- Support for multiple books in one project.
- Design based on [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/).
- Markdown content is now being loaded with [next-mdx-remote](https://github.com/hashicorp/next-mdx-remote). This means content is now separated from routed pages.
- Auto-centered layout on big resolutions leading to one less configuration option.
- 40% smaller bundle size.
- Navigation bar.
- Updated dependencies.
- Refined mobile UI.
- Less code (−4,000 LOC).

#### But what do you mean by “Pilot”?

AAM institute is **not currently live**. We’re doing a bunch of tests right now to create our final approach and guess what? You’re one of our lucky guinea pigs.

We've put hours and hours into research to find the online sources and tools that we believe are the best, and we’ve combined them into this introductory course.

We believe the process we’ve put together with these materials is the fastest and most fun way to get up to speed with coding basics.

**This course is free for you because it’s a test. We are only opening it to a very small amount of people.** Can you help us out by letting me know how your experience goes, what questions you have and where you struggled most?

**I’ll be with you every step of the way to help.**

#### What happens when I complete Dev101

Once you complete the free pilot for Dev101, **you’ll be eligible to join our AAM Pilot Program for free as well!**

Spots are **EXTREMELY limited** in the AAM Pilot Program and will only be available for **a very short time**. We will be accepting only those that finish Dev101 first and have the best test results.

So if you want to join our AAM Pilot Program for **free** (a ~$2,500 value), work hard on Dev101, finish it quickly, but make sure you learn the material and do well on the projects/tests!

!> Warning: Do not skip anything!
We have built this course very carefully, so **please do not skip anything!** I repeat, **do not skip anything!** We spent so much time cutting this down to the most important information only, so every step is essential.

##### Good luck and thanks for joining the AAM community! We can’t wait to work with you.

**My advice to you is to take this course seriously.**

> It’s not easy. You have to tell yourself you can learn anything with enough time and focus.
