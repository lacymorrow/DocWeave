The back end or server is what allows websites to serve different content to different users. A server uses a programming language to generate pages on-the-fly and "serve" them to the client (which is you!). A server or cloud is just another computer or array of computers setup to be publicly accessible by the internet.

### 5.1 Introduction to the Back End

[The Odin Project gives a brief overview](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-introduction-to-the-back-end) to the differences between the front/back-end and the relationship to client/server. It also discusses dynamic sites and why they are useful.

### 5.2 Introduction to Frameworks

Frameworks speed up development and make building large-scale applications easier. [Here's an introduction to frameworks.](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-introduction-to-frameworks)

### 5.3 What about PHP?

PHP is an open-source server-side scripting language that many devs use for web development. It is also a general-purpose language that you can use to make lots of projects, including Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs).

Follow along and [learn the basics of PHP in this guide](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/what-is-php-the-php-programming-language-meaning-explained/).

### 5.4 Project: Dynamic PHP Header

Create a new PHP notebook at [https://phpsandbox.io/](https://phpsandbox.io/). This is an interactive playground you can use to play with PHP. Use the **Standard** template to create an example PHP page.

**Create a dynamic header that is shared between two pages.**

> [Live Demo](https://phpsandbox.io/n/aam-instituteproject-005-ynxhg), take note of the `composer.json` file, this contains configuration info for PHP projects

Using the **File Explorer** on the left side of the page, create two new files called `about.php` and `header.php:`

- `about.php`: This file should be similar to your HTML/CSS project with a brief description and contact info about yourself
- `header.php`: Create a navigation template that includes links to both `index.php` and `about.php`

Include this dynamic header at the top of both `index.php` and `about.php`. The header should allow the user to easily navigate between the two pages.

Share the link to your PHPSandbox notebook into the [AAM Discord](https://discord.gg/5fY5efPd)!
